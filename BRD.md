# Business Requirements Document (BRD) – TÀKÀRÀ

## Executive Summary
TÀKÀRÀ is a mobile‑first creative writing and storytelling platform for African writers across the continent and diaspora.  It provides a space for emerging and established writers to create, publish, and share original stories, poems, essays, and opinion pieces in African and international languages.  The platform eliminates public comments and visible likes to reduce performance anxiety and fosters a safe environment where engagement is measured privately via reads, followers and bookmarks.

## Business Objectives
1. **Empower Writers:** Enable African writers to self‑publish and control their content.
2. **Promote African Narratives:** Support multilingual expression across tribes, languages and regions.
3. **Community Focus:** Build a community that values authenticity and reduces social comparison.
4. **Open Source & Scalable:** Develop with open‑source technologies, CI/CD pipelines, testing and monitoring.
5. **Monetisation Foundations:** Lay the groundwork for future contests and publisher partnerships.

## Problem Statement
